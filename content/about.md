## Jay Landro 2019

Compassionate team developer with 20 years experience. Highly skilled in devops, cloud/serverless development and front-end mastery. 

"Jay has extensive knowledge of front end processes and is quite honestly the smartest front-end guru I've
ever worked with. He always has a plethora of recommendations on any given front-endy subject. He is
always very vocal in meetings and brings his best ideas forward helping the entire team excel, and often
times helping the team accomplish a task easier than was initially thought. Jay is constantly pulled aside to
help other team members, in fact he and I have a meeting scheduled today to pair up - he's a team player
and does a great job at helping others. He actively reaches out to help other team members when they are
stuck on something, and he does a great job helping on-board new team members."
